Improve the quality of your code by accelerating your coding/testing workflow ðŸš€

**Boost your TDD-Workflow by:**
* âœ… Creating a proper `xyz_test.dart` file with boilderplate code for an existing `xyz.dart` file with one click!
* âœ… Switching between `xyz.dart` file and the associated `xyz_test.dart` file instantly 
* âœ… Dramatically faster test execution  -> Run only the unit tests that affect the file you're currently working on.
* âœ… Using snippets to avoid writing boilderplate code
* âœ… Automatically keep file and folder structure in sync between /lib and /test even if you rename or move a file or folder
